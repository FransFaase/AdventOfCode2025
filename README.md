# Advent Of Code 2025

My effort for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) contest.
All times are for Central European Timezone (CET).

I am going to use [MarkDownC](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/?tab=readme-ov-file#markdownc)
again, like I did in the past years. MarkDownC is a tool for
performing literatie programming with MarkDown files. It parses one
or more MarkDown files and outputs all the fragments of C code found
in those files, rearranging them such that all the definitions are placed
in an order that can be compiled. When a certain function or variable
declaration is repeated, the last version is put in the output.

### Monday, December 1, 2024

I woke up around 4:15 and did not fall asleep again. Around 5:45, I was sitting
behind my laptop waiting for the puzzle to appear. I had forgotten to open the
file for the input to be pasted into and also gave it the wrong name when I saved
it the first time. My answer for the first part was correct in one go. For the
second part, I required two tries. I had already somewhat expected that the first
try was going to be wrong due to a combination not shown in the example input.

ee further [Day 1](Day01.md) and [day01.c](day01.c).

### Personal stats

The columns 'Gold' and 'Silver' contain the numbers from the [Stats](https://adventofcode.com/2025/stats)
page after I finished both parts. This gives some idea of my global ranking.

```
Day   -Part 1-   -Part 2-   -Gold-  -Silver-
  1   00:09:36   00:17:35      869      2484
```
