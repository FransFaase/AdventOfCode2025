# Advent Of Code 2025

My effort for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) contest.
All times are for Central European Timezone (CET).

I am going to use [MarkDownC](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/?tab=readme-ov-file#markdownc)
again, like I did in the past years. MarkDownC is a tool for
performing literatie programming with MarkDown files. It parses one
or more MarkDown files and outputs all the fragments of C code found
in those files, rearranging them such that all the definitions are placed
in an order that can be compiled. When a certain function or variable
declaration is repeated, the last version is put in the output.
